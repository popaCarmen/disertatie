/*
Download the program into Arduino board and power on monitor for serial port. Then real-time distance values measured by LiDAR and corresponding signal strength can be viewed.
In addition, data curve can be viewed in curve plotter for serial port, provided, however, that the above code regarding printing for serial port should be modified:
//  Serial.print("dist = ");
Serial.print(dist);//output measure distance value of LiDAR
Serial.print(' ');
//  Serial.print("strength = ");        
Serial.print(strength);//output signal strength value
Serial.print('\n');
Reinterpret and download the program into Arduino board and power on the curve plotter. Then two curves representing dist and strength can be viewed.
